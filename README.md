# Algorithm for Encode/Decode String
here i have converted the string to the base64 but i haven't used inbuilt buffer method to change the base
Here i have used my algorithm to chnge the string base to 64 and it will also reduce the length of string 
here i have firstly created a variable with all cases of alphabets(upper,lowers,+,-,/) and run function and convert the string to shortened string
andd the algorithm you can find in routes/userRouter
