# Algorithm for Encode/Decode String
Here i have used Ceasar Cipher Algorithm to encode/decode the string
So i have first created a object of alphabets and numbers where the key and values both i have used as alphabets where the key and value the differ by 13
e.g- a:'n' and n:'a' and printed the value corresponding to that key. So that how this algorithm is encoding and decoding the string.
